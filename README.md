# e-calculator
C++ code to approximate the value of e (Euler's Number) through the use of Monte Carlo Simulation

In this simulation, we are solving for the expected value of the following experiment: How many random numbers between 0 and 1 are needed have a sum greater than 1? As you will see in the simulation, the answer is e. 

Please see the following paper for more details on the experiment: https://doi.org/10.2307/2685243
